To install your note-taking web application on a WAMP server, follow these steps:

    Install WAMP Server:
        Download the latest version of WAMP server from the official website (https://www.wampserver.com/en/) according to your system's architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).
        Run the installation file and follow the on-screen instructions. Choose a suitable installation directory (e.g., C:\wamp64). During the installation, you may be prompted to choose a default web browser and text editor. Select your preferred options.
        Launch WAMP server after installation. You should see a green "W" icon in your system tray, indicating that WAMP is running.

    Create the MySQL Database and Tables:
        Open phpMyAdmin by clicking on the green "W" icon in the system tray, then selecting "phpMyAdmin" from the menu. Alternatively, you can access phpMyAdmin by navigating to http://localhost/phpmyadmin in your web browser.
        Log in to phpMyAdmin using your MySQL root credentials (default password is usually empty).
        Create the note_app database and tables by executing the SQL code provided in the previous response. You can do this by clicking the "SQL" tab in phpMyAdmin and pasting the SQL code into the text area, then clicking the "Go" button.

    Prepare the Application Files:
        Organize your application files into a folder structure, ensuring you have the following files:
            HTML files (login.html, register.html, dashboard.html)
            CSS file (style.css)
            JavaScript file (script.js)
            PHP files (login.php, register.php, notes.php, fetch_notes.php)
        Update the PHP files with the correct database connection information (hostname, username, password, and database name).

    Deploy the Application on WAMP Server:
        Copy your application folder (e.g., note_app) to the WAMP server's www directory (e.g., C:\wamp64\www).
        Ensure WAMP server is running (green "W" icon in the system tray).
        Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost/note_app/login.html (replace note_app with your application folder name if different).

    Test the Application:
        Test the functionality of your application, including user registration, login, note creation, updating, and deletion. Verify that the application works correctly and troubleshoot any issues that arise.

By following these steps, your note-taking web application should be installed and running on a WAMP server.
